# Fishing data analysis (Mini coursework)

This is the courework project in partial fulfilment of Fundation of data science module.

## About project

The report investigates sucient time and bait type for fshing by using a sample of fshing data
in a single day. Using the existing library, for example, Pandas, Matplot, NumPy, Seaborn, to ma-
nipulate or visualise the sample data to demonstrate the insight of sample data. Consequently,
the statistic method and related graph are used to answer the question of the best time for fshing and
bait, which is suitable for fshing in either general time or a specifc time.
## Main features
The project aim to deliver the fundamrntal of ststistic method application in order to answer to
simulated business question as mentioned below;



- How to identify the best time for fishing?
- Which bait is the of effective of fishing?
- Which bait must be used in some specifc time range?

However, the project was implemented on top on sententic fishing dataset named "fishing.csv"
which are contain 400 row of sample data represented fishing data in one day.


## Project dependencies
Statistic method, Data analytic, Python, Visualisation lib. (Matplot, seaborn, etc.)
